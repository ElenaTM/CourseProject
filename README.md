# CourseProject

This course project has 5 different parts:

1. First, the training and the test sets are merged to create one data set.
2. The measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement are selected. 
(some variables meanFreq are in my file not selected)
3. The names of the activities are changed: instead of using id numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the names
than can be found in the activity_labels.txt are used. 
4. The names of the data set are changed. Descriptive variable names are here used. 
5. From the data set in step 4, a second data set is created. Independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject are here selected.
